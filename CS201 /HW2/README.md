### Focused topic of the course: Efficiency of searching alorithms

  In this homework, you will study the search problem. That is, given an ordered collection of items (i.e., a
sorted array of integers) and an item of the same type to be searched (key) in this collection, the problem
is to find out if the key exists in the collection or not. 
If it exists, your solution needs to return the position of the key (i.e., the index). If not, it needs to return -1.
