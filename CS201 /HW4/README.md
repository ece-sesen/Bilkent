# CS201 Homework 4

### Focused topic of the course: "Queue" implementation 

In this homework, you will read city inforation from "CityGrid.txt" file.
Building city using those infÄ±rmations, spread the virus among blocks. While 1 represents healthy blocks, 2 shows infected blocks. 
0 displays the blocks which do not have people inside so virus cannot affect those blocks.

Calculate the minimum time (number of days) it will take for the infection to reach every healthy block in the city. 
If the infection cannot reach all healthy blocks (because of empty blocks), state that as described in output section.

In your implementation, you MUST use queue for spreading virus among blocks in each day. Program should not have any memeory leak at the end.
